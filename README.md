# ADRC-Motor-Control
A collection of MATLAB (.m) files for analyzing the frequency response of a separately-excited DC motor using the Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) technique. Code for the paper "[Robust Control of a DC Motor](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844020326207)."
